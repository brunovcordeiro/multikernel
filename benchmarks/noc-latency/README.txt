This benchmark computes the latency betweem IO-node and clusters using portals OR channels.

=========================
GENERAL IDEA
=========================

First, the IO-node sends messages of different sizes to all clusters using portals (asynchronous messages).
Then, all clusters send messages of different sizes to the IO-node using portals.

The result is written in the output directory (output/).

An R script (plot.R) is available in the output/ directory to plot the results.
This script can be used "as it is" to plot the results generated by "./run_all.sh"

=========================
COMPILATION
=========================

$ make

=========================
EXECUTION
=========================

To run with a specific number of clusters type (example with 2 clusters):

$ ./run.sh 2

To run all tests with different number of clusters (1, 2, 4, 8, 16) type:

$ ./run_all.sh
